I recommend this to beginners who are getting started to learn web development. (HTML-CSS-JS) <br> 
These might not be the perfect projects, but developing these, will help you a lot throughout your learning journey.

Just a quick note. I've developed these myself. Just a two of them are based on youtube tutorials.<br>
Have fun
